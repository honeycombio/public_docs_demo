Before getting started, in order to have the best experience with Honeycomb, you should have access to run, modify, and deploy source code for at least one app or service.

In this section we walk you through adding an integration, instrumenting your code, and sending synthetic test data to Honeycomb from your dev environment. Once you've successfully sent data into Honeycomb from dev, you'll be ready to deploy and start learning more about what's happening in production!

Review the [before getting started](/getting-started/before-getting-started/) checklist to ensure you have access to what's necessary. Next, follow the [first steps guide](/getting-started/first-steps/) to configure your app to send telemetry data to Honeycomb.
